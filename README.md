## Feature-Sliced Design

I know it is an overkill for such a tiny project but I still want to give it a try. You can learn more about it here [feature-sliced design](https://feature-sliced.design/)

## React query

React query is a nice tool to deal with cache on FE side. No doubt that it is way easer to use it rather than implement all needed functionality from scratch. Anyway if you insist on implementing something similar to it then PR is welcomeðŸ˜‰

> Files with http extension are lightweight version of swagger. To work with it properly you should install extension based on your editor

## TODO

- save search results as get parameters to give user possibility share link
- rewrite usePeopleQuery with infinite query
